# A Basic Vanilla PHP CMS

This repository is a simple PHP CMS meant to be used as a starting point. The code consists of a simple login process, a dashboard, a place to view/add/edit/delete users, and a place to view/add/edit/delete projects. In an effort to keep the PHP code focused and basic, only the absolute basics have been included. The whole CMS only consists of HTML, vanilla PHP, and SQL.

A few notes regarding the CMS:

- There is no form validation
- Security is very basic
- Image uploading is done through a separate page using a basic servers-side script
- Images are stored in the database as a base64 string
- Image resizing is done through [WideImage](http://wideimage.sourceforge.net/) (you'll need to add this to the includes folder)


## Tutorial Requirements:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (or any code editor)
* [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (or any FTP program)
